# CSS Code Refactoring

The aim of this project is to refactor the existing code to meet the accessibility standards, without changin the appearance of the web page.

Whilst, ensuring that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Refactoring

- It is made sure the project follows correct logical order of smantic HTML elements and standards. 
- `Index.html` has been added with comments for clear identification of elements.
- Clear, concise and descriptive title has been provided with an added favicon.
- Various additional classes has been refactored into one simple class, which can be used in various elements simultaneously.
- Images are provided with the clear `alt` attributes, which can be accessible in the event of image load failure.
